In the Gaussian RBF,

Image 1:-
in the formula we see a term "L^i". This thing is actually the centre point, the zero point of the whole 2D plot
"(x-L^i)^2" represents the distance between the two point and the centre point and squares it
and e^(above term divided by 'sigma' whatever), is actually the 3rd dimension variable 'z'
And for each point on the dataset we plot it and does project it to the higher dimension

Image 2:-
Technically, sigma defines how wide the circumference actually is

What technically happens is that sigma is varied on conditions and the computation actually happens in 2D and not 3D
So it becomes computationally effective. This is the "kernel trick."

Image 3:-
We can even use 2 such kernels and add them up and give conditions to vary the sigma to get a good result
